# Snake and Ladder Game in C++

This project is a C++ implementation of the traditional Snake and Ladder board game. The game is designed to be played by two players on a virtual board. Each player takes turns rolling a dice to move their marker forward in an attempt to reach the final square (100) before the other. The board includes ladders, which advance the player upwards, and snakes, which pull the player downwards, adding an element of unpredictability and excitement to the game.

# Features
- Interactive Gameplay: Play against another player in a turn-based format.
- Random Dice Rolls: Each turn involves a dice roll that determines how many squares the player moves forward.
- Snakes and Ladders: Encounter snakes and ladders that can either pull you down or push you forward, significantly changing the dynamics of the game.
- Winning Condition: The first player to reach the exact 100th square wins the game.
-Graphical Display of Board: Although textual, the game provides a clear display of the board's state after each turn.
